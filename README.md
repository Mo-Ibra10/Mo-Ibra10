<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Mohamed 👋</h1>

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate **Back-end Developer** specialized in **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
I focus on building reliable, secure, and scalable REST APIs that power modern web and mobile applications.  

I enjoy designing clean backend architectures, working with **databases** like MongoDB, and integrating third-party services such as payment gateways and authentication providers.  

I’m constantly learning about **system design**, **microservices**, and **deployment workflows** to deliver high-performance and maintainable applications.  

💡 My goal is to craft backend systems that are not just functional — but efficient, elegant, and easy to scale.
